#You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers 
#from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:1 
#print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and
#not every step of the calculation
#you will need to use the range() function in any of the solutions.
